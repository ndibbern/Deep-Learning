# MATH-398-Deep-Learning
## Course Description

**Practice.** In this class you will learn how to implement and train deep neural networks with Pytorch. Pytorch is the deep learning library developed by Facebook’s artificial intelligence research group. We will focus on image recognition and natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis, speech recognition and translation. 

**Theory.** Deep neural networks are trained with stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. A good chunk of the class will be devoted to understand what are these things and why they work so well to train deep neural networks. 



**GPUs and Cloud Computing.** In order to train deep neural network we need GPUs. We will use Google Cloud Platform in order to have access to GPUs. Each student will be given a good amount of credit on Google Cloud Platform (we have a Google Educational Grant for this). There will be many programming labs: all of them will be conducted with Jupyter Notebooks on the cloud.
